          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I've deeply immersed myself in the world of software development
            during my journey with Northcoders. Armed with a distinctive blend
            of sales expertise and robust communication skills, I am dedicated
            to becoming a junior software developer. Within the coding
            landscape, I proficiently navigate through JavaScript, Python,
            CSS/HTML, Node.js, Django, and SQL, ensuring not only functional
            solutions but also infusing a touch of finesse into the creation of
            reliable code. My GitHub,
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Geno419?tab=overview&from=2023-11-01&to=2023-11-30"
              target="blank"
              >here</a
            >, stands as a testament to my dedication, showcasing a portfolio of
            practical, hands-on projects that not only highlight my technical
            proficiency but also for continuous improvement. What truly
            distinguishes me is the fusion of my sales background with my coding
            aspirations. Moving seamlessly from negotiating deals to
            communicating effectively, these soft skills act as my secret weapon
            in the coding world. They don't just complement my technical
            abilities; they elevate my collaboration, problem-solving, and
            creativity.<br />
