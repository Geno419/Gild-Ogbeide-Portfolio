# Gild Ogbeide Portfolio

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is the source code for my site, where I showcase my skills, projects, and a bit about myself. Feel free to use this as a template for your own website.

## Getting Started

To kick things off, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geno419/your-portfolio.git
```

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser, and voila! You're ready to view your new portfolio.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick rundown of what's in the box:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content of your portfolio.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet that gives your portfolio that stylish look.
- **linkedinLogo.png**: LinkedIn logo image.
- **githubLogo.png**: GitHub logo image.
- **logo.JPG**: Your website logo image.
- **siteBackground.jpg**: The background image for that extra flair.

## Customization

Now, the fun part! Customize to your heart's content:

1. **Content**: Update the details in the `index.html` file with your own info, projects, and links.

2. **Styling**: Tweak the styles in `style.css` to match your vibe.

3. **Images**: Swap out my images with your own profile picture and logos.

4. **Background**: Change the background image by replacing `siteBackground.jpg` with your favorite pic.
